# teambuilding-profiles

This command-line application within Node renders an HTML page after it takes in employees information from a team.

## Description

This command line application has an end goal of generating an HTML page with dynamic card creation using template literals.
Each employee will have different additions based on their role. The manager will input the information regarding each employee that they would like to add
to new cards on the webpage.

## Problem

There is no way for the Manager to track the employees and add in new employees based off of their role within the organization.

## Solution

Create a command-line application that generates an HTML page with the ability to add employees and display them within their own cards.

## User Story

As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic information.
So that I can have quick access to their emails and Github profiles

## Experience and Learning Opportunities

- This experience overall was amazing because the building process helped to focus on modularization and class/ constructor functions.
  _Learning Opportunities_
- refactoring filter in a way that permits singular array outputs instead of multiple.
- testing all of the roles to ensure they pass.
